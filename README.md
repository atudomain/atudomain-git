## Installation

Install using pip:
```bash
python3 -m pip install atudomain-git --user 
```

Otherwise, just can just append downloaded repository path to PYTHONPATH.

## Quickstart

Import Git class:
```python
from atudomain.git.Git import Git
```

Create Git object:
```python
git = Git('/home/user/example-repo')
```

### Getting branches
Get list of remote origin branches:
```python
branches = git.get_branches(include='^remotes/origin')
```

Get list of local branches:
```python
branches = git.get_branches(exclude='^remotes/')
```

### Getting Commits
Get list of Commits for the current branch:
```python
commits = git.get_commits()
```

Get list with last Commit for the current branch:
```python
commits = git.get_commits('HEAD^..HEAD')
```

### Getting Commit details
Get committer date from Commit:
```python
committer_date = commits[0].committer_date
```

Get commit id from Commit:
```python
commit_id = commits[0].commit_id
```

Check if Commit is a merge:
```python
is_merge = commits[0].is_merge
```

### Executing commands in repository
Get 'git status -s' output as a string:
```python
result = git.run('status -s').stdout
```
